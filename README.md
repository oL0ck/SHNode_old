  Hi there, this is example of my home automation code works
This module compiled by me before i found PlatformIO, so it is totally Adruino prohect.
It works for me someting about 3+years, collecting data in my home about hummidity, CO2, Tvoc, temperature.
It tested\works on Arduino 1.8xx, with esp32 enviroment, just later, i upload here nubrer of libs i used. 
All of kibs id out of date, but still works, if it needed.
Thnx(:
